# Balor

## About

This repo contains the graph compiler and GNN Quality of Results estimator of Balor, an HLS source code evaluator. 

The graph compiler is built using ROSE (available at https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose), and we provide two sample outputs, for gemm and FFT from machsuite (https://github.com/breagen/MachSuite).

The GNN Quality of Results estimator encorporates code from GNN-DSE (https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/GNN-DSE), under the BSD 3-Clause License. Copyright (c) 2022, UCLA VAST Lab. All rights reserved.
